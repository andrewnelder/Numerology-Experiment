This is a just-for-fun study of numerology that is based on my idle curiosities of the subject.  According to the divination experts, numerology's most important calculation
relates to that of your birth.

This study looked at (from what I understand of the field) the most common method for deriving this value.  It also considers master numbers: 11 and 22.

Basic definitions of life path meanings were extracted from [Astrology-Numerology](http://www.astrology-numerology.com/) (c) Michael McClain 1996-2011.

Sample datasets (including a list of Nobel Peace Prize winners and famous visual artists) were extracted from [Freebase](http://www.freebase.com/) (c) Metaweb 2011.
