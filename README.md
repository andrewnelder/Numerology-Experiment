This is a just-for-fun study of numerology that is based on my idle curiosities of the subject.  According to the divination experts, numerology's most important calculation
relates to that of your birth.

This study looked at (from what I understand of the field) the most common method for deriving this value.  It also considers master numbers: 11 and 22.
